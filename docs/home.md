The Digital Shopfront CMS Accessibility package provides a set of icons for use in the Digital Shopfront CMS as well as a way for developers to add their own icons and to call them based on category and type.

You can use the functions in this package through the Facade or by directly calling the functions.

```
use ArtisanPackUI\Icons\Facades\Icons as Icons;

echo Icons::getIcons();
```

`echo getIcons();`
